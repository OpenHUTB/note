## Absolute size IoU loss for the bounding box regression of the object detection

The responses have well addressed all my concerns. I recommend accepting it for publication.



## 第一次修改
This paper develops an AIoU loss function to overcome the limitations of the current commonly used loss functions based on Intersection over Union (IoU) in advanced algorithms. It can promote bounding box regression, and it can replace the invalid term to optimize the model. In addition, it can make the model focus more on the difficult objects when model training. Some experiments have been performed to prove the effectiveness of the method proposed. However, there are several drawbacks the authors should to solve:

1. In the introduction, key motivation of the paper is unclear. I recommend the authors to rewrite the introduction.

2. The intelligent perception in title may be too big for this paper. If this title is used, it seems that the experimental are insufficient to prove it. 

3. More other algorithms should be compared to demonstrate its effectiveness in the experimental section. Not just a comparison of own methods.

4. There are some grammar errors in the paper.

I think this manuscript should be revised and reconsider to our journal.



## Rethinking Trajectory Confidence for 3D Multi-object Tracking in Autonomous Driving

The paper tries to propose a trajectory confidence scoring model based on the inter-frame consistency of the trajectories for 3D multi-object tracking in autonomous driving.
But the innovation of this work in trajectory confidence is insufficient.

Second, the paper has some mistakes and obvious erros making it hard to read and follow. 
For example, in figure 5: Runtime and accuracy comparison of detection results on the KITTI [?] test set. 

Finally, I think this is an implementation paper/software, and not an innovative approach to 3D multi-object tracking.

Spatial-Temporal Regularized Multi-Expert Object Tracking via Improved Background
Learning


Reviewer Comments to Author

This research develops a spatio-temporal regularized multi-expert correlation filter-based object tracking approach with improved background learning and an efficient multi-expert tracking framework. Both the target and its background are considered to enhance the performance, and with the help of expert evaluation based on reliability score the best expert is chosen for the tracking result. Some experiments have been performed to prove the effectiveness of the method proposed. However, There are some problems need to be addressed��

1. In the related work, the introduction about CF-based tracking and CNN-based tracking is unclear. I recommend the authors to rewrite the related work about this part.

2. In the proposed methodology chapter, if it is not your own work, you only need to briefly explain, rather than listing other people's work.

3. More newest OTB datasets should be compared to demonstrate its effectiveness in the experimental section. Not just a comparison with OTB13 and OTB15.

4. There are some grammar and formula symbol errors in the paper.
